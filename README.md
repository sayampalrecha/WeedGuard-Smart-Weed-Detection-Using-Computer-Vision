# WeedGuard-Smart-Weed-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
## As part of the submission of our final year project we have designed a YOLO based model to identify weeds in Indian agriculture 

### Tech stack
- Front-end for model UI
- Python and ML for transfer learning
- Weed image Dataset for 5 seperate classes of weed (1000 images) 



## Used the YOLOv5 model for the project implementing Transfer-Learning on the weed images dataset.
